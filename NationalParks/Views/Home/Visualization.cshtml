                            From the pie chart above, considering all the age groups between 24-50 the total number of crashes
                            occured in a year is around 82 thousand. The highest number of crashes occured is 16 thousand and it falls by the group
                            of age 30 and its almost similar to the crashes that occured by the 25 year age group in that particular year.
                            Less number of accidents occured by the age group of 23 and 29 compared to the age group of 27 and 40.
                            Overall, the least number of accidents are made by the age group of 50 since they engage in safe driving ,
                            Wearing the seat belts. The average number of crashes are more likely to be happened by the age group of 27-35.

                            The highest number of crashes happened at VERMONT AV  where the least number took place at the MAIN ST.
                            FIGUEROA ST falls in the second place with a difference of 175 compared to the VERMONT AV.

                            From the pie chart we can find that many more Men than Women are casualties of car accidents.
                            Over the course of a year men represented 60 percent of casualties while women accounted for 40 percent.
                            Studies have shown that men are more likely to be associated with anger, risky and dissociative styles
                            where as women are more associated with patient driving styles. 16-19 year olds are the highest risk to be
                            involved in the accident. Teens are more likely involved in crashes due to rash driving and lowest rates of
                            seat belt use compared to other age groups.

                            From the barchart, the maximum number of collisions took place in 77th street which is 35 thousand.
                            whereas the least number of crashes occured in foothill.
                            In West LA, N Hollywood, Olympic and Pacific happend to have same number of collisions
                            which is around 28 thousand. Where as in Harbour and Rambart we have seen around of 22 thousand accidents.
                            So comparing all the states the average number of collisions occured in all the 21 states is around 21 thousand.
